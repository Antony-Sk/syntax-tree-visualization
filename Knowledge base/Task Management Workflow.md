**Some tips**:
- Bullet points are nice, use them in description of task
- Try to make description of task concise
- Capture every idea you have

## Description of lists

### Inbox

Add anything related to the project that come to your mind.

The purpose of this list is to capture everything related to project. Anything that
comes to your mind should be added to this list. Afterwards it will be
processed and put to the corresponding column.

> **Important 1:** Write task the way you can understand what you meant some time
later. If you have time - write it in the way that everyone understands it.

> **Important 2:** Even notes should be captured here if you don't have
> time to write them to the `md` file.

### Doing

This list contains tasks on which we are currently working on.

Write `Taken: Your Name` at the bottom of the task if you're doing it.

### Todo

This list contains tasks that should be done in the following week.

Tasks at the top of the list have higher priority.

### Blocking tasks

This list contains all the blocking tasks (tasks that should be finished
to start the other ones)

Prioritize this list over `Todo`

### Done

This list contains all the tasks that were done. It is useful to have it
to see the progress.

### Projects

Project is a big task that has clear finish criteria. Projects should be
processed by several people to define all necessary information about it
(finish criteria and at least one step)

Finish criteria format: `Finish criteria: description of criteria`

All the subtasks should have link to the project in format of
`[Short name of project](actual link)`

### Someday

This is the list of all cool features that may be implemented, but they are not prioritized for now.
(some of them may be very difficult or even impossible to implement)
